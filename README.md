## Problem Statement
Rural tourism in India has immense potential, but most villages lack digital visibility. Travelers often depend on intermediaries to book stays and activities, leading to reduced income for villagers. There is no simple platform for discovering and booking authentic rural experiences directly, which limits economic opportunities for local communities and prevents travelers from enjoying genuine cultural immersion.
